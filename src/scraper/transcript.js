/**
 * Click the Transcript control inside the open Details panel and verify

 *
 * Control selector: getByRole('tab'|'button'|'menuitem', { name: /transcript/i }),
 * combined with .or(). The Details panel is built on the same shadcn/Radix
 * primitives as the rest of the app (see details.js), and Radix Tabs —
 * the standard way that family implements in-panel sections — exposes
 * each section switcher as role="tab". Since it isn't certain from the
 * outside whether this control is a tab, a plain button, or a menu item,
 * matching all three ARIA roles by accessible name "Transcript" (instead
 * of guessing one) maximizes the chance of hitting the real control
 * without depending on one specific implementation.
 *
 * Verification: resolve the exact panel the control declares it opens via
 * its `aria-controls` attribute (the standard ARIA tabs contract — a tab
 * points at the id of the panel it reveals) and wait for that specific
 * element to become visible, falling back to any role="tabpanel" inside
 * the dialog if `aria-controls` isn't present. Radix Tabs only mounts the
 * active panel's content by default, so the Transcript panel does not
 * exist in the DOM at all until its control is selected — its appearance
 * is a real, positive signal the transcript view opened, not an
 * assumption based on the click having been dispatched.
