/**
 * Click the "Brands" tab.
 *
 * Selector: getByRole('tab', { name: 'Brands', exact: true }).
 * GetHook renders the Explore Ads / Brands switcher as
 * <button role="tab">Brands</button>. Role + accessible name is what a
 * real user (or screen reader) uses to identify the control, so it keeps
 * working across Tailwind class or DOM-structure changes that would break
 * a CSS-class or nth-child selector. `exact: true` avoids accidentally
 * matching an unrelated control whose label merely contains "Brands"
 * (e.g. the sidebar's "Brand Spy" item).
 *
 * Synchronization: this waits only on elements — never on the URL or on
 * any notion of "the SPA has finished loading." Two elements matter here:
 * the tab itself (visible + enabled, so it's safe to click) and the
 * "Search brands" combobox that only exists once the Brands page has
 * actually opened (so we can tell the click actually worked).
 *
 * That second check exists because the tab is clickable — and clicking it
 * does start a route change — even while GetHook is still running its own
 * one-time post-login redirect. When that redirect fires after our click,
 * it silently overwrites our navigation and we land back on the default
 * Explore/Ads route instead of Brands, with no error thrown. Since the tab
 * element itself looks identical (visible, enabled) whether or not that
 * race happens, waiting on the tab alone can't detect it. So this makes
 * the click idempotent instead: click, verify the Brands page actually
 * opened by waiting (briefly) for the search combobox, and if it didn't
 * show up, assume the click got overwritten and click again — bounded to
 * a small number of attempts so a genuine failure still surfaces as an
 * error rather than hanging.
